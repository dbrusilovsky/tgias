Design Direction
Color Palette

Primary Colors
Charcoal - #2D2D2D
Your dark mode background foundation.
Burnt Umber - #1f562a
Richer and more sophisticated than terracotta. Less "adobe house," more "aged leather and mahogany."
Secondary Colors
Warm Ivory - #F5F1E8
Primary text color. High contrast against charcoal while being gentler than pure white.
Olive Gray - #f2cd8d
Secondary text and borders. Recedes appropriately without disappearing.
Accent Colors
Forest Green - #2D5016
Replaces the teal. Earthy and grounded, suggests growth and stability. Works beautifully with burnt umber in dark mode.
Amber Gold - #D4A574
Hover states, highlights, premium indicators. Catches light against the dark background.
Warm Slate - #545B5E
For cards, elevated surfaces, and subtle depth layers on the dark background.


Typography

Font: Use system fonts or Inter if you want to import
Hierarchy: Clear distinction between headings and body text
Sizes:

H1: ~42px desktop, ~32px mobile
Body: ~18px, line-height 1.6



Layout Style

Modern, clean, professional
Generous whitespace
Mobile-first responsive
Full-width hero section with gradient or image background
Contained content sections (max-width ~1200px)
Alternating left/right layouts optional for variety

Visual Approach

Hero: Leave a placeholder for an image to be added.
Icons: Use simple line icons for the value prop cards (lucide-react icons work well)
Keep it clean - let the content breathe

Technical Requirements
Must Have

Fully responsive (mobile-first)
Fast load time (<3 seconds)
Accessible (proper heading hierarchy, alt text, keyboard nav)
Semantic HTML
No external dependencies if possible (self-contained)

Nice to Have

Smooth scroll animations (fade in on scroll)
Subtle hover effects on cards/buttons

Tone & Content Style
Voice: Professional but approachable, confident without being arrogant
Writing style:

Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
Clear and direct
No jargon unless necessary
Active voice

What to avoid:

Over-promising specific products or features
Too much technical detail
Marketing buzzwords ("leverage", "synergy", "paradigm")
Anything that sounds like a generic tech startup

Keep It Simple
This is a professional company page, not a product landing page. Focus on:

Clear identity (who we are)
Credibility (government-backed research)
Accessibility (easy to contact us)
Clean, modern design

Don't overcomplicate it. 
Reference the Current index.html
The existing page has:

Nice gradient background (purple/blue)
Clean header/footer structure
Responsive grid for features
Good mobile breakpoints

Reuse what works:

The overall HTML structure is solid
The responsive approach is good

Replace:

"3D Model Viewer" branding → Company branding
Product-specific content → Company overview

Keep the page lightweight and fast
Prioritize clarity over cleverness
Mobile experience is critical
Don't reveal proprietary information about specific projects

Goal: Visitor should think "This is a credible, professional company doing serious infrastructure work. I should reach out."

That's it. Build a clean, professional company landing page that positions TGIAS as a credible infrastructure technology company.
